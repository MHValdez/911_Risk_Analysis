# SaaS Application for Fire Department 911 Risk Analysis

Medium-term risk analysis SaaS application for Levrum Data Technologies

This is the 8-week capstone project for my CS degree program that I worked on as part of a 6-student team.

## Outline

The application takes data from a relational database (Microsoft SQL Server) of municipalities and fire stations and a NoSQL (MongoDB) collection of map nodes. It visualizes response times for a selected collection of stations.

The team was given a large codebase in two disparate GitHub repos. These had been developed separately by previous teams.

The team:
- Organized into two groups: database and control plane
- Managed our planning and execution within an Agile Scrum framework **
- Learned C#/.NET
- Learned Entity Framework **
- Learned Auth0 and Stripe APIs
- Familiarized ourselves with the code bases
- Implemented a SQL solution for relational data that had been stored in CSV files **
- Implemented GridFS to store large, non-relational collections in chunks on MongoDB
- Implemented Auth0 login *
- Implemented Stripe payment *
- Integrated control plane elements with the SQL database, requiring cross-group coordination **
- Wrote comprehensive tests and performed manual API testing with a Swagger interface **
- Performed code reviews **
- Created a migration plan for the two repositories (both contained unique, desired functionality)
- Documented installation and usage **

*\* I was not directly involved with single-starred elements but had to stay informed for coordination*

*\*\* I personally executed double-starred elements*

Our sponsor contacts at Levrum informed us they were impressed by our autonomy in planning and execution and were happy with our work.
