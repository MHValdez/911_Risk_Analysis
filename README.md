# SaaS Application for Fire Department 911 Risk Analysis
Medium-term risk analysis SaaS application for Levrum Data Technologies

This is the capstone project for my CS degree program that I am currently working on as part of a six-student team.
We are still in the planning phase. Code and other specifics are under NDA. Here, I've provided an outline of the product we're developing, a link to the company website, and a link to my development blog. Come back later to see our progress.

## Outline
My team is charged with developing a full-stack, self-serve, multi-tenant, Software-as-a-Service application that assists fire departments with medium-term risk analysis based on map and GPS data.
UX example: the user can view maps or charts visualizing response times to different areas of town based on fire department locations.
